# Paying Respects to Cleopatra

![Preview of Collage Example](https://github.com/awhite2/Portfolio/blob/main/Cleopatra'sRespects/Collage.png)

Cleopatra's suicide has been depicted many times throughout history in art, literature, theater, and film.
However many of the depictions were constructed by men and were highly eroticized and sexualized. 
The purpose of this interactive collage generator is to bring respect back to her death.

This web program generates unique collages based on the artistic choices noted below. 

## How to Use
Running [index.html](https://github.com/awhite2/Portfolio/blob/main/Cleopatra'sRespects/index.html) will initialize the collage generator and generate the first collage.
Try it out [here](https://abra-white-portfolio.netlify.app/cleopatra'srespects/).

### Interaction üñ±Ô∏è
A mouse click will generate a new collage. 

Moving the mouse across the screen will change the color of the tree from green to yellow. 


## Artisitic Choices

* A flower is selected and placed over Cleopatra's heart.
* Playing on the idea of collage, an animated Barnsley fern is generated, using a collage theorem IFS.
* As Cleopatra was sometimes depicted as Isis (the Egyptian moon goddess) in Egyptian art, a moon is place behind her.
* The original artist's name is prominently displayed.
* The palm tree changes from a dead yellow color to a lush green depending on the mouse position.
* The colors of the shapes are selected from a palette based on the original artwork.
* The circle and square are restricted to certain areas and sizes, but change with each generation
